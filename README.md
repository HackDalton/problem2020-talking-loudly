# HackDalton: Talking Loudly

## Problem:

I heard that someone is transmitting the flag in parts on [server]:[port], but someone else is transmitting a bunch of nonsense to try and prevent you from hearing it.

## Hints
1. Try running `man grep` in terminal to read the manual for the `grep` program
2. Read about [pipes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)).

Look at the writeup [here](./WRITEUP.md).
